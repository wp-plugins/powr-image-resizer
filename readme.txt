== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to create a POWr Account? = Yes, you need a POWr Account.  Your account allows you to edit plugins right in your live webpage, and to recreate plugins across many different sites.

= How do I add Image Resizer to a page or blog post? = Add the shortcode **[powr-image-resizer label='Enter any label here']** to any page or post. Then visit your live site to edit.

= Can I add more than one Image Resizer? = Yes, absolutely!  To clone your Image Resizer, just add the exact same shortcode to pages or posts.
